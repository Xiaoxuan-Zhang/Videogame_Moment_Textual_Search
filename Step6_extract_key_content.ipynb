      "you happening and where is here wait there's the lighthouse I hope please let me make it there holy shit wow that was so cerejo mostly called film little pieces of time but he could be talking about photography as he likely was okay in class everything's cool I am okay from light to shadow from color to chiaroscuro now can you give me an example of a photographer who perfectly captured the human condition in he didn't fall asleep and it sure didn't feel like a dream Bueller weird Diane Arbus there you go Victoria why Arvest because of her look at this crap how can I show this to mr. Jefferson I can hear the class laughing at me now images of hopeless faces you feel like totally haunted by the eyes of those sad mothers and children she saw humanity is torture a little camera bag is battered but still kick you should keep that to yourself if anybody else looked at this what would they think seriously though I could frame any one of you in a dark corner and capture you in a moment of desperation and any one of you could do that to me I believe max has taken what you kids call a selfie a dumb word for a wonderful photographic tradition and Max has a gift of course as you all know the photo portrait has been popular since the early 1800s your generation was not the first to use images for selfie expression sorry I couldn't resist the point remains that the portraiture has always been a vital aspect of art and photography for as long as it's been around now max since you've captured our interest and clearly want to join the conversation can you please tell us the name of the process that gave birth to the first self-portraits I did no but I kind of forgot you either know this or not max is there anybody here who knows their stuff Louis Daguerre was a French painter who created dig area types a process to give portraits a sharp reflective style like a mirror now you're totally stuck in the retro zone sad face very good Victoria the daguerreian process brought out fine detail in people's faces making them extremely popular from the eighteen hundred zone word the first American daguerreotype self-portrait was done by Robert Cornelius you can find out all about him in your textbook or even on one hey guys don't forget the deadline to submit a photo in the everyday heroes contest I'll fly out with the winner to San Francisco where you'll be feted by the art world it's great exposure and it can kick-start a career in photography so Stella and Alyssa get it together Taylor or don't hide I'm still waiting for your entry - and yes max I see you pretending not to see me yes Victoria you still have to do your oh hi max I just really think Caden I hope I didn't embarrass you with my lame answer it sucks to be dragged into the spotlight unless you're Victoria she's got nothing on you max well I should get going yeah me too talk to you later sure I also want everybody to know that this photographic world is not for everybody I had my moment and excuse me mr.

a deal max you're a better photographer than a liar now I know it's a drag to hear some old dude lecture you but life won't wait for you to play catch up you're young the world is yours blah blah blah right but you do have a gift you have the fever to take images to frame the world only the way you envision it now all you need is the courage to share your gift with others and that's what separates the artist from the amateur you didn't tell me how cute I look yet I was about to not paying into the real world hot then I might send you a special would you plays it social I need a serious timeout in the bathroom splash water on my face and make sure I don't look like a total loser I hate that guys it's so fucking boring she's so fucking shot empty could nobody can see my meltdown except for me

a real trip has been pop I can tell you early 1800s your generation so I can go back and tie this for selfie expression what if that girl isn't dead yet and resist the point can I see a manager has always been a vital aspect of art and photography first you to go to the bathroom quickly and check it out now max since you've captured our interest and clearly want to join the conversation can you please tell us the name of the process that gave birth to the first self-portraits I'm sorry but I really have to use the bathroom nice try max but you're not gonna get away that easy we can talk more after class is there anybody Jefferson wants to keep me after class and I need time to save that girl a process to give portraits a sharp reflective style like a mirror now you're totally stuck in the retro zone sad face very good Victoria what if I rewind a gariand process in the right answer now max the daguerreian process invented by a French painter named Louis Daguerre around 1830 somebody has been reading as well as posing nice work max the daguerreian process made portraiture hugely popular mainly because it gave the subjects clear defined features you can learn more when you actually finish reading the assigned chapters max is so far way ahead of that and guys don't forget the deadline to submit a photo in the everyday heroes contest I'll fly out with the winner to San Francisco

go straight to hell do anything but I bet Victoria did I know speaking of selfies let's play a little photo Tetris and leave Victoria a message let's move this here and this one there hmm a pattern is

your attention he usually does hang in there Juliet see you're on max obviously can't go there the whole town is turning into one giant missing-persons poster damn somebody is seriously devoted to putting up these posters now this really pisses me off so entitled sorry handicapped folks my truck needs these two spots more than you do bastard that dog looks peaceful asleep but if I get too close

wrong time Warren but then so am i you okay it's been one strange fucking day I bet I heard Victoria got a face full of paint I'd pay money to see a photo of that really I wish I would have known you probably could have raised a Kickstarter fund just for that one image of her covered in paint how'd I know that anyway Victoria took down my photos so that drama ended well by the way I saw Daniels sketch of you online not bad but I could do a much better job Daniel posted it online already that was nice Congrats you're part of his online portrait posse don't be jealous I'm sure he'll ask you

would be a nice photo of Chloe framed by the Sun sure you don't want to be alone have a seat Pete you're in a good mood seeing my step the door could get played makes me happy I'm not as brave as you and David is indeed a step douche I'm sorry you had to experience it firsthand you have to live with him has he always been this way ever since my desperate mom dragged his ass to our home I never trusted David he freaked out on poor Kate Marsh today I know her she's cool only that prick would bully her yes some kind of weird agenda he has a lot of secret files Rambo still thinks he's gathering enemy intelligence did you take a peek well yeah I couldn't help it never change what did you find creepy photos of Kate Marsh other Blackwell students this dude takes this job too seriously he still thinks he's at war or something he's a total surveillance fetish or their spy cams in the house I knew you didn't know Chloe your house is under surveillance what are you talking about there are cameras all over the house I saw it on a monitor in the garage I knew it he is so hella fucking paranoid I'll keep this a secret for now sometimes ignorance is bliss no wonder I'm so miserable everybody in this town knows everybody's secrets what's Nathan's secret he's an elite asshole who sells bad shit cut with laxatives and he dosed me with some drug in his room what I met him in some shithole bar that didn't card me he was too rich for the place and too wasted and he kept flashing bills just tell me what happened Chloe now I was an idiot I thought he was so blazed it would be an easy score you needed money that bad actually yes I owe big time and I thought I'd have enough for me and Rachel if she showed up how much do you owe three grand plus interest and before I could get a chunk of that from Nathan he dosed my drink with some shit God Chloe I can't believe this I mean I do then what I know I passed out on the floor I woke up and that perv was smiling crawling towards me with a camera go on everything was a blur I tried to kick him in the balls and broke a lamp Nathan freaked so I managed to bum rush the door and get the hell out max it was insane Chloe that is so fucked up what did she do then I figured I would make him pay me to keep quiet so he met in the bathroom and he brought a gun that was Nathan's last mistake what are you going to do pop a cap in his ass let's call the police screw that you already told the principal and I'm sure it's useless I won't always be there to save you you were here today max you saved me I'm still tripping on that seeing

to worry about being late anymore I do have all the time in the world now oh shit now I'm getting anonymous threats it never ends this has to be from Nathan but it could be anybody I better be doubly careful around here or I could be in serious danger if I'm not already Kate you in there yes I'm here I'm in maths Kate used to play the violin every morning she stopped last week hate is all alone dealing with this video bullshit I hope her mother doesn't disown her that's a lot of tears she's going to go through boxes Kate really has a doting father I had no idea that Kate ever hung out with Elissa and Stella that is the cutest bunny ever I bet Kate is a good mommy hey I'm trying to use my powers for good ouch she left out AM nation good lord this must be Kate's HR Giger period poor Kate

zombie family Kate even makes notes in her Bible my parents never once took me to church I had nothing to rebel against I don't know what to believe now it's way too emo in here Kate isn't that gloomy until lately Kate's art is perfect for a children's book everything looks so fun and colourful and positive why did she cover up the mirror if she can't look at herself almost forgot what Kate looks like when she smiles hey Kate I brought your book max why did you step in between David and me yesterday I had no choice David Madsen is an asshole you had the choice to not get involved nobody here seems to care about anybody Kate I actually do care so what's the story with you and David well he's a total paranoid ass he thinks I've heard of the vortex Club Yeah right what about this video and I swear I haven't watched it I can't even watch it max I won't either Thank You max you know how humiliating this is for me I know this sucks Kate but tell me about the video and maybe I can help basically I went to one vortex club party and ended up making out with a bunch of people and I have no memory of it so why would you go lapse of sanity I just thought I could meet some new people you have to tell me more than that what happened at the party did you drink I swear to god I had one sip of red wine and then I drank water not enough to get wasted is it I don't get wasted ever I take us up at church and I don't end up on a viral video okay did somebody drugged you I remember I remember getting sick and dizzy go on ahead Nathan Prescott said he would take me to the hospital Nathan Prescott oh shit he was being nice for a change when he offered to help me he's the opposite of nice what next all I recall is driving for a long time and I woke up in her room I thought it was a hospital because it was so white and bright go on I'm listening somebody who was talking to me in a soft voice I thought it was a doctor until I heard Nathan and felt a sharp sting in my neck and and are you sure of course you think I'm making this crap up why no I'm just being deductive as usual then what happened that's all I remember I don't know what happened I woke up outside my dorm room the next day I didn't have any marks or bruises but I felt gross so who took the video of you at the party I have no idea probably Victoria she was there being her mean self Jesus Kate I'm sorry this is serious shit how do I get a viral video taken down I know it's already spreading what if my church sees that I need to know what to do Kate we'll figure it out I'll check back later okay thanks max you can put my book here near my bag so max can I ask you a question and please be honest absolutely Kay anything I need to find out if Nathan Prescott helped me or hurt me after that party should I go to the police yes you should definitely go to the police Kate I totally believe every word you say Nathan Prescott is truly dangerous bless you max I will go to the police and also principal Wells with you is my backup witness they'll have to take us seriously now backup witness well I mean I believe you are in everything but we're still just spoiled punk students to the cops and faculty I just think we need to be very careful here fly careful of what nothing except the Prescotts are a powerful family I hope this won't backfire on us that's all even though that rich bastard has earned some serious bad karma he'll get it time out max you actually told Kate to go to the police and the principal after getting a scary text threat now the police will definitely drag you into this shit I don't have time max I can't talk now how hard is it to dump the trash into a bin release the Kraken come on squirrels time for your 15 minutes of fame can't Black will have at least one no football zone yes another Pulitzer for the portfolio Samuel we really should keep this locked it's a waiting accident and too easy to sneak into I can see that Samuel is concerned but does he need a poster how did Samuel get photos of Rachel posing I've never seen Samuel wearing shades and what's with this other crap the birds are flocking around Samuel ah here's Samuel up early already communing with the critters hey Samuel you're up early oh hello young max I do love the morning everything is so calm cry and I can feel the animals waking up quickly sorry to pry Samuel but why are there photos of Rachel amber in your shed I'm curious about her sorry to pry she says well prying now everybody wants to know about her I know people who cared for her people who are looking for her if she can be found thank you that's the nature of mystery it's no mystery that you have her pictures yeah she gave out headshots like squirrels chasing through keep on prime next sounds like you have a lot of time on your hands that's one thing I truly love about Arcadia Bay it's all those cool animals in the forest the squirrels always come in the morning for food I can hear them whisper what animals do you singing them forests don't laugh but I saw a doe that seemed to be looking right at me like it was trying to communicate oh that's your spirit animal nothing weird there except you saw yours could be a sign about your destiny what do I know my spirit animal is a squirrel so what did you think about that freak snow shower yesterday another message from the earth to get our shit together I will say that Samuel hasn't seen anything like that I so don't want to get in the way of your morning ritual see you later of course you will I don't think I've actually seen Taylor alone without team Victoria hi Taylor hi Taylor just because you were nice to Victoria doesn't mean I have to be nice to you I don't want to fight with you or Victoria instead of smack-talk let's just talk for once you're funny well I'm not doing anything at the moment so talk Kate is really upset about the video all this gossip is cruel boohoo that's what happens when you preach to everybody about sex she'll live why do you hang out with Victoria she's pretty mean to you in Courtney and she's bossy too look you don't know her I do and she's one of the best friends you could have I guess I've had really bossy best friends - better than having mean bossy parents I would love it if my mom was mean or bossy instead of sick but whatever we've had our talk hi Taylor hi Taylor I've heard that your mother was sick I'm so sorry what what happened to her well if you do care my mom had back surgery Victoria was there for me like you are for Kate I'm not about tearing people down nice I know that's why I wanted to talk I'm glad we did hi again Taylor hey that wasn't such a bad talk we should do it again see you later you know that conversation didn't suck give peace a chance max Conover you Warren is out and about already - looks like he's waiting for somebody Lauren what are you doing here oh nothing waiting for a call I mean I already took the call anyway I wanted to rap about that action yesterday by the way thank you for stepping in you were pretty badass Warren I owe you oh yes you do I got knocked on my ass by that dick I'm some personal superhero you're a real everyday hero you stood up to a bully and it was awesome even though you left me with said bully and ran off with that girl she's pretty punk rock how do you know her an old friend Chloe price we haven't seen each other in a while I bet you're glad to see her blast up in that truck like a rock star which begs the question why he's Nathan Prescott getting psycho on you I busted him in the bathroom yesterday with a gun I'll give you the story later principal Wells has taken care of it now I hope you're fucking weak like that bizarro snowfall yesterday speaking of dystopia that driving is having a 70s Planet of the Apes marathon

wish young girl Arcadia Bay just isn't the same fishing town I grew up in has the town changed much by Neptune's beard it has seems like a lifetime ago when I was king of the harbor you did pretty good to have lasted this long oh the fish used to jump onto my boat until the Prescotts and their finance fiends snapped up Harbor rites the Prescotts have a lot of power they might rename the town Prescott Bay if that tells you much they own my school crooks gain respect when they put their names on schools and libraries let's not get down caste I hear the fish calling for Bali Hai never forget that old fisherman never died we just smelled that way I'd love to learn more but I have to get going happy fishing out there obviously nobody took my advice there's that dirty RV from the other day stop dad stop larkey there was something creepy about that guy in his dog excuse me sir can you believe this town the world is on fire and our big headline is snow I can hardly wait for next week's

anything in their way I know somebody who's been threatened by a press card then you be their guardian angel because nothing gets in the way of that family especially not the law hell they own your school blackwell almost how long have you lived in Arcadia Bay a thousand years I've gone through the same changes as the town what happened to you what didn't happen to me sometimes you start out in life turned around the wrong way I'm married dumb made mistakes got cheated out of my savings lost my home and now I hang out here I'm sorry have you ever lived outside of here where the hell would I go I hate the Sun and love the mist I might be homeless but Arcadia Bay is still my home I have to go now goodbye man that smell of breakfast and the sound of clangs silverware makes me feel thirteen

with Portland meteorologists in the area and look at some of your fun video reactions to the odd snow flurry who knows maybe Mother Nature was pranking us all so stay tuned to k-bay Seven News for the real story that graffiti has been here forever gross Thank You redneck poet this guy has serious corners oh man I bet that's the same gum from when I was here last hello there to you such a beautiful day oh yeah it's gonna be a super day enjoy your breakfast date I always wonder what people think about when I eat alone these fishermen are so damn quiet to catch any big ones today if by big you mean none then sure I caught a lot of big ones today now let me mourn over my eggs yeah that really looks unpleasant what do you want I feel like shit so much beer so spare me please just let me suffer quietly that Officer looks nicer than wannabe cop David Madsen hello sir hi young lady you look a little lost just hungry and thinking about what to eat now that is a real problem at the two whales I can never decide choices pumpkin pie or grilled mac and cheese I guess you're friends with David Madsen I wouldn't use that word we know each other why do you ask he kinda has a reputation at Blackwell I have respect for David he served his country he found his calling in Blackwell at the station we're happy David is exactly where he is not everybody can be a cop How well do you know Joyce I know her delicious grub everybody at the station comes here we take care of this place like it's our own kitchen and Joyce like she's our our mother so you know Chloe sadly we all know Chloe down at the station poor Joyce just heard that Chloe even had a pot dealer in her room uh who told you that I didn't hear it on the police scanner Joyce said the we belong to Chloe's friend but I highly doubt Joyce didn't tell you who she wouldn't afraid I'd go arrest somebody as if I would I just tell that loser to stay the hell away from Chloe or else just kidding besides David Madison's watching over is she a friend of yours I know her did you know she's a handful she can be but she can also be a good friend who shows up when you need her sounds like your good friend I wish she would be a great daughter and not cause joy so much stress I have to go now enjoy your breakfast by the way one thing I can tell you for certain is to stay away from that RV outside I usually stay away from sketchy parked vehicles wise policy the guy who lives in it Frank it was pretty sketchy himself that's all I can say for now I should finish up my coffee and get to work I wouldn't last one day as a trucker those rigs are too damn big I don't feel like talking right now I gotta deliver a load of breakfast to my stomach over and out truckers have such a romantic life always on the road uh hello pardon moi but you're in my eyesight isn't everything in here within eyesight I don't care for your tone you sound like Joyce how does Joyce sound bossy and smartass like you why are you being so rude because I've been on the road for 12 hours straight hopped up on coffee and diet pills carrying two tons of nitrate and all I want to do is eat a quiet breakfast and stare out the window do you mind truckers have such a romantic life always on the road and there she is lovely young woman how are you doing Matt hi Joyce it's nice to see you again you look the same hmm like I'm still a waitress at two whales after all these years no like you still look pretty nice save kid you're still smart but not that smart now you get busted for smoking pot I heard the whole sordid story from David I'm sorry this was how you had to meet him he's a good man no matter what Chloe says yeah I'm sure I don't even smoke when ever it was almost an accident it was very stupid him I'm sorry it surprised me fierce I was hoping you could be a good influence in her life now I will be promise I know things were hard for you and Chloe I feel bad I didn't call now my folks are in Seattle and I'm all alone at Black whoa it's my karma you did the right thing you moved forward with your life I did after William passed on Chloe Chloe chose to stay angry anyway I hope we see more of you Chloe needs an old friend again Joyce I am so sorry about William I have great memories of him I'm glad max that was his gift to us wonderful memories even if Chloe doesn't understand yet Cole you must have changed a lot during that time oh she had all the phases expulsion running away drugs bad boys tattoos piercings blue hair now she's got a rebel against her stepfather I see why I mean do you he's not as much of a hard-ass as you think but you did tell him you had a joint right you took that responsibility David scared me when he said he might have my scholarship taken away for that stupid joint nobody's in trouble over a doobie max and I admire that you took the heat for Chloe like a great friend but Chloe does push David and it's not fair he paid his dues in a war he does care about her along with all the students at blackwell he cares about Kate Marsh David mentioned her but I'll stay out of his business I won't patrol Blackwell and he won't cook at the diner you know I saw him arguing with Kate I thought you might know why nice try Nancy Drew but next to you there's only one student I'm worried about and she's not even in school anymore so now let's get down to the nitty-gritty what do you want to eat the last good Belgian waffle I had was here when I was 13 years old so bring it on now finish your coffee one Belgian waffle for The Hungry Girl pronto oh yes black coffee you will be mine

Jefferson loves to shoot around here you must know mr. Jefferson pretty well right now I certainly know him as a talented artist and terrific teacher I've been here a little longer but he's made a bigger mark I have to say it's not quite autumn enough yet what about that snow yesterday what's your scientific explanation our climate is moving beyond explanation of course some of the tribes here might see it different I'm sorry miss grant but I have to get going go on max we'll talk again real soon thing hey Warren are you okay you look thoughtful yet confused Maxwell's silver hammer perfect timing I need help with this chemical experiment asking me for help means you're screwed have that either a bit of potassium or sodium it's up to you to decide dr. max I'm not sure why you're letting me decide your fate but go TAS iam potassium it's OB if this works you get a free hug weird science hi again miss grant right back at your max miss grant can I ask you a possibly down the science question you know my stock teacher answer there are no dumb questions ask away would you have potassium or sodium to a chemical mix for this week's experiment neither unless you want to face little powder I would add chlorine I'm sorry miss grant but I have to get going go on max we'll talk again real soon hey Warren hex was asking I have that wrong Warren you need to add chlorine not potassium or sodium chlorine I didn't think of that can argue with a confident scientist let's try it Yurika she's got it no you got it don't be so modest dr. Caulfield oh you guys really broke the bounds of science that was fun helping Warren he's pretty cute when he's in full-on geek mode howdy Brooke hi max making your daily rounds I'm helping Warren with his latest experiment oh I guess he needed a neophyte assistants so he wouldn't be threatened but you came to his rescue anyway apparently it's my nature yet Warren ignores the experts right in front of him not that he would ask me for help anyway how is your drone miss grant busted me flying it over the parking lot she's all jacked up about surveillance bullshit like I was spying on Warren's new car you already planted a GPS on him I borrowed the one he has on you I hate to hit and run but don't let me get in your way so long wonder why they don't use real skeletons stop acting so you can't help me I'm trying but you have to understand my position y-you don't understand mine nobody does nobody what do you want from me please leave me alone leave me alone stop don't come near me excuse me max you come over here sure you look worried is everything okay just between you and me I'm worried about Kate Marsh that's no secret word on the street is that you and Kate had a little confrontation with our security chief yesterday I stepped in between David Matz and barking all up in Kate's face about something she doesn't deserve that of course not mr. Madsen isn't the most gentle soul do you have proof II instigated the situation my word isn't good enough but one time I choose not to take the picture always take the shot my number one rule of photography and max I promise this matter is being discussed by the faculty I assume you know about this viral video kate is freaked out by all of this she can't do homework Ross she's being tormented on a daily basis what if Gabe brought this on herself she means well but maybe she doth protest too much she seems like she's holding back the truth have you talked to her yes I talked to her on the phone today she needs friends and support now I just don't want Kate Marsh to become the next Rachel amber Rachel amber what does she have to do with Kate with all her missing persons posters around it's hard not to think of her I miss Rachel too but think about yourself max principal Wells told me about what you said happened in the bathroom it did happen Nathan Prescott had a gun in the girls bathroom yesterday this is a serious accusation max so you don't believe me I would never make something like this up I hope so max but it's easy to point fingers if mr. Madsen claims you might be a pot dealer as he did should I believe him listen should I excuse me minutes hello yes hold on I have to take this so just go into class and I'll be there soon make me beautiful hate it what's up Daniel waiting for a Dana after Hayden gets his paparazzi on roll I hope you liked the sketch I did a few yesterday long and it's my new avatar excellent I got tons of likes on FB made u+ Sheriff someday your portrait may hang in a Daniel they cast a wing of the loof we'll talk about it later not now max I'm contemplating shit Stella is smart to stay out of all the drama I'm kind of doing something now max no time to talk max posing in progress do you think max will be pissed we're sitting at her desk like I give a flying fuck or she'll run to mr. Jefferson like he gives a shit like anybody does max is such a little Shh I think she can hear us I can't believe the principal lets him stay in school after I told him what happened even if Victoria ignores me I'm glad we talked yesterday better be quiet Victoria we have a master snitch and liar here did you think we were best friends forever or something not at all Victoria Max is such an attention whore you would know can I sit down now oh please do take a selfie of this moment yeah max so I won't forget you assholes okay why is David taking photos of Kate now this is so wrong and weird what up max hey Warren I saw Kate earlier in her eyes were puffy from crying kate has a lot on her plate I didn't know what's the same didn't tell me okay I know you love me but if you're not in this class beat it everybody else please sit down man to cover today and so little time as usual I see all the usual suspects here anybody seen Kate Marsh I think everybody has seen Kate Marsh by now not feeling it sounds like you're giggling about a video gone viral maybe it involves a student or a friend I wonder how it would feel to have false images of yourself shout out all over the world for people to judge no smart phones in class max put that away usually people need something to judge so they never take a good look at themselves we can thank reality TV for some of that in the end we can only blame ourselves for participating speaking of participation there are a few souls here who have yet to enter a photo in the contest like max Caulfield for example who I know can't wait to enter right I'm sure you read the syllabus like it was a Harry Potter book so you must know today we're studying hero spear oh that beautiful word about the contrast between light and dark the shadow play that gives photography such visual power its basic yin and yang black and white images are effective precisely because of their contrasts although we don't technically see in mono some crazy shit is going down with the girls door zakariya do not come into my class like that ever again listen everybody remain seated dismissed is this for real it's looked okay oh god I have to do something to her she can't die she can not again not now I have to try something I won't be able to rewind again and again keep going max you can do it you yes what are you doing here Mac stop don't come near me

video it was written on the shower room mirror are you serious thank you so much the fact that you don't care about that video and would come up here to stop me means a lot of course like I said this morning I think Nathan is involved I just need time to prove it and I have a way with time it sounds so persuasive max Oh me Kate I believe you will you believe me please you don't have to do this not cuz I'm in a nightmare and I can't wake up unless I put myself to sleep then everybody at blackwell compose pics of my body horny on the internet forever no wonder they call it a web nothing can ever get out like my video or she could go back in time and erase everything nobody cares Kate there'll be another viral Victoria video in a day and everybody will forget you can't scrub my video from the internet and that's how I'll be remembered unless like jump hey you can't do this to all the people who care about you No nobody cares about me nobody I saw that cute photo of you with your sisters in your room this morning I can see how much your little sister loves you buy her smile that's Lynn she's only 10 she does have the best smile ever I would hate to see her sad then make Len happy and step towards me if she was here you would know what to do this isn't the end Kate there's no way God doesn't have big plans for you here nice try Mac but God put me on this roof come to me all you who are weary and burdened and I will give you rest Matthew 11:28 I can't believe you quoted one of my favorite passages like I said I care about you I know this passage means a lot to you I'm sorry yeah sorry what are you talking about you saved me from talking in class now I know today was difficult for everybody but I'm so proud of the way Blackwell pulled together to save a young girl's life of course you're quite a hero for getting Kate to come down max I didn't do much she's modest like a real hero yeah real hero as principal of Blackwell Academy I take my duties seriously I take the well-being of every student more seriously what happened today should never happen in a Hall of wisdom and knowledge mr. Madsen as our head of security here those roof doors should always be locked that's just standard operating procedure they were not and that is indeed your responsibility mr. Jefferson I know you can't be expected to know what your students are going through but Kate has assisted you in class so you should have known something was amiss mr. Prescott since you are responsible for the vortex Club parties and since miss Marsh did attend your last party you'll have to answer some more questions miss Caulfield why exactly were you on the route with Kate Marsh did she tell you her plan or anything at all please tell us everything all I know is that Kate was at a party and Nathan dosed her she got wasted and kissed some boys on a viral video without a clue i doused her huh  have you seen the video what ever kate was loaded and you're like I revealed you told Kay you took her to the emergency room I said I was going to take her to the ER she sobered up eventually bullshit something happened to her and you know it how about we talk about you waiting a gun in the girl's back that's total slander I could sue you and this school so fast I already have a personal lawyer careful mr. Prescott I have been told of this alleged gun incident and I have to admit that the video in question was sent to me by multiple sources including me and since mr. Prescott does appear prominently in the video and was responsible for the party I have no choice but to suspend him until further notice whatever see in court excuse me I think max and Nathan need a break before we grill them further a friend and student just tried to kill herself they don't need this forum right now yes I'm kind of devastated right now I'd like to be with my family all right miss Caulfield please sign here to confirm what you've told us I'll continue this investigation from there my head is killing me but I think I can use my power again well I think we know less now than when we started we'll be assisting the police with further enquiries I know this has been a stressful day I wish I had the power to change it all for the better so thank you for coming in I couldn't even believe it was happening it was literally slow motion as I grabbed her hand and then I could feel her grabbing mine next that was the greatest thing I've ever seen ever you reached out she reached out hugs tears applause like a superhero quite look at me I'm a mess you're glowing seriously a human halo I'm pretty sure you earned your wings today I'm still worried about Kate she did try to kill herself all over a video pyrole is the right word like a disease so you watched it just one and a half times Lauren I don't mean to sound weird but there's something ominous going on at blackwell today proves that and I'm working on proof that Kate Marsh is connected to Rachel amber somehow along with Nathan and mr. Madsen I'm not a big conspiracy guy but I wouldn't doubt it Nathan did scare me yesterday and Madsen is a straight-up dickhead so what do you think is really happening what the hell is this the weather confirms this weird day feel that chill thanks there was no Eclipse scheduled today I would know I would I believe you Warren I believe anything this week you \n",

we want and beat it my powers only go so far man I can see why the principal locks this room up fancy for crap he must want everybody to know he has money but no taste how can you trust somebody who has a fucking bronze bird in his office I'm glad I was expelled yes if only the principal had a Monet or Picasso you'd still be a black whoa eat me I'm gonna pill for the papers on this ugly ass desk okay sure it's ugly but damn is it a cozy chair this is your chance to truly get all deductive and shit Sherlock find us some clues about Rachel or Kate Nathan anybody I'm on the case this pretty much sums up Kate shy and sweet and in the wrong place only two more files to go Chloe say hello to my little friend say good night to the bad guy that is so cool that my signature actually counted go miss grant tumbleweeds so Nathan Prescott's dad is a bully too shocker dude I know I shouldn't be going through the principal's files but it's kind of cool now's your chance to get revenge on Blackwell oh

master we heard this asshole has a spotless record like I'm not gonna read my own personal file this file is going to be so spotless I'll projectile vomit I have to make sure Warren doesn't have a criminal background let's nab this last file Sherlock always wanted to say nab I drink to if I was the principal of Blackwell and nothing here Rachel doesn't seem so troubled based on all this but there's not much here about the police investigation man I don't blame the principal for expelling Chloe bad Chloe I think we found everything in here I should go join Chloe now max you better come check out these files nathan accuses rachel of bringing drugs on campus and my step troll went along because he thinks a rachel was a bad influence on me assholes if David is teaming up with Nathan Prescott that's a bad sign Nathan Prescott the third who he's so money and you know the Prescotts dropped major bank to Barry Nathan's real file look it reads like a rap sheet bad grades teacher complaints secret probation but I was expelled at least Nathan was finally suspended check outside no open it it's just some crazy drawing it's not a drawing look Rachel in the dark room Rachel in the dark room over and over that's it that's fucked up what does this even mean Nathan is truly psychotic I know he has something to do with Rachel missing whoa listen to this David M always asks what's

failed trying to rescue Kate maybe I'm just stumbling back and forth in time for what reason you didn't stumble when you saved me max not that time but that's because you were there to kick-start my power so it's time to start moving forward in time and we're obviously connected since without me you would have never discovered your power right absolutely you make me feel like I know what I'm doing and you make me feel like I have a reason for still being in Arcadia Bay I hope so stop being so goddamn humble you're like the smartest most talented person I've ever known more than Rachel amber dude I'm not her groupie okay and I'm sure you have Blackwell Bros all over you like Warren Warren is nice huh nice ouch that means friendzone no he's really cool it was so sweet when he stood

live so I'll be safe okay into the car Oh always remember this moment photobomb photo hog it feels like a different world from yesterday we left a skid mark on Blackwell last night like it needs another one I'd like to do something good for my school in Arcadia Bay I can't even submit my photo to represent I just don't want to be rejected every great artist gets rejected before they get accepted so you have to enter a photo even though I'm pimping the school in town you want to torch come on I don't want to see our Cadia baifern to the shore I just say shit like that because I've been trying to get out of here since since you left basically I could find Rachael than pay Frank off I'm still leaving to start a whole new life I wish we could just hang out all morning like we used to maybe we should get up I have to get back to Blackwell soon Oh does the school girl have a test today I'm starting to feel like going to black well every day is a test I just need to get home a regular school schedule again okay I need to get dressed now man if I had stayed hidden David wouldn't be targeting me Frank might think twice about messing with Chloe now but if David finds out shitstorm nice Chloe put my pic on her phone I must have proved I was worthy again Jesus now I am glad Chloe took that money this guy is serious and scary Chloe seems more relaxed now that she has that money from the handicapped fund I love this morning light so peaceful wouldn't it be wicked if we could just hang out here forever like when we were kids yes but we sadly were not kids anymore at least you can date now right my dad was terrified of the day I would discover boys as Blackwell proves boys are trouble and way fucking gross as you'll discover soon enough okay woman of the world please tell me what it's like to get that first magic kiss sorry sorry didn't mean to get you all worked up I just don't think anybody is good enough for you besides me hey lazy ass put some clothes on and we can scarf the awesome breakfast choices cooking up Oh at least we haven't been identified yet thank god she's okay I wonder when I can visit her can I check out the news on this old laptop Chloe is so damn cute she's really trying to suss out what my vision means I'm lucky David didn't bust me for acting like it was my part time to put on your daily armor max yeah still reeks like a chlorine Factory see if you can find a suitable outfit in my fashion hole if you want go ahead and check out the closet for some fresh clothes man if I had stayed hidden David wouldn't be targeting me okay time for some Chloe cosplay hey there you go Rachel left a bunch of her clothes with me she's your size but not quite my style max you don't have a style yet at least give it a try you can always rewind back to your chlorine brand t-shirt engineer jeans you suck I like my certain genes but it would be cool to try on Rachel's clothes just to see if they fit stop second-guessing yourself max put this on and let your inner punk rock girl come out you can afford to take chances whatever and whatever you want to try for example I dare you to kiss me what I double dare you kiss me now damn you're hardcore max now I can text Warren and tell him he doesn't stand a chance unless he's into girl-on-girl action you're such a dork oh man that was priceless when I kissed Chloe she didn't think I would you better not rewind and take that kiss back you know I'm hotter than those Seattle art holes right I think Rachel's style is a little more subtle like me looking sick max a couple tabs some piercings and we'll make a thresher out of you yet ready for the mosh pit Shaka brah maybe not go on down and say hi to Joyce free breakfast I have to wake and bake first I promise not to tell let's not rewind and find out Kay yes I might go to hell for this but if it saves Chloe we'll pay it back somehow Wow I remember this old phone we decorated it together the fact that she put the photo next to Rachel so touching wowser that was my tenth birthday and then no Chloe kept this stuff hey can you play that again oh my god that smells so amazing it's like when we were kids here what's ironic is I always hated it when Chloe used my toothbrush you know I haven't gone through a dyeing my hair blue phase yet maybe it's time Chloe has had this damn dirty pirate towel since we were kids serious flashback anyway that's the Bluebird I saved Monday in Joyce's room David this is officer corn just want to let you know your stepdaughters car was identified near the blackwell campus last night around the time of the break-ins what room are you in trouble again Chloe don't you sleep message deleted goodbye message I think Chloe has earned a break from all this bullshit I keep expecting to see the sky turn red oh look at the poor bird it seems kind of freaked out bird because flying fool oh look at the poor bird seems kind of freaked out Joyce looks so different in her street clothes good morning Joyce Rachel uh I mean max who would you startled me but you fit those clothes well thank god you're not a Hellraiser lock her up Chloe now tell me exactly what you want a towel on I'm dying for some of your famous pancakes I thought you would have missed those ah you ate more than William and he loved them I remember we would race each other to grab them from a stack so this time you can help me with the ingredients I need you to grab me the eggs and milk eggs and milk no problemo the eggs always come first as Joyce used to say now for the Mother's Milk I love that they still have the same refrigerator Thanks after all these years and everything that's happened it's great to see you and Chloe together again she hasn't had a good friend since you were Rachel those clothes remind me so much of her such a sweet girl I'm just hoping she's living large in LA I'd love to think that to Joyce but we're on the same page max I keep hoping that Rachel will show up or even send a message to Chloe from Hollywood or wherever she is I hate to even think this much less say it out loud but I think rachel is in serious trouble I know I'll watch those awful true crime shows and it makes me ill if I think about Rachel ending up on one so I don't think too much I see why Chloe is so obsessed with finding her max Caulfield are you actually jealous of Rachel what no way I know I was selfish when I left I'm glad Chloe found a better friend no just a different one last time I saw you and Chloe and your pirate outfits I knew she would never find a better friend and when you took the rap for that joint he approved it Thanks but it seems like Chloe and me were pirates a thousand years ago and that makes me what a century old you're only 18 max Oh youth if only I could go back it's not all that Joyce voila a breakfast fit for us Queens and a king go sit at the table how's Chloe still eats the same cereal so do I I guess nobody waters the plant here oh man I don't want to be famous for this thank you so much choice I'm never leaving this table good you can clean I'm glad as creamy and not crunchy now that's what I call pancakes seeing you again ah made me remember so much I know these photos don't measure up to your work max my favorite photographers probably take pictures similar to yours you make David happy choice he wants us all to be happy max he's just not great at showing it I don't think I can rock this outfit like Rachel you have your own cool style Wow sir I totally remember that day I'm glad William took this picture with his instant camera oh it was the last picture he ever took he had his car out right after this and I know choice I'm sorry I didn't show you this to be morbid in fact I want you to have this this was when my baby was so full of life and light she was hopeful positive in everything she's not today and this was the last time I ever saw Chloe truly happy did you guys have a bonding session about how fucked up I am it's not always about you Chloe please it's too early to start picking a fight eat instead I'll keep the warden busy while you go peek in the garage now stop whisperen or I'll know you're talking about me not being so nosy mother geez I can't do anything around here without everybody getting up in my shit no one can even joke with you Chloe you fly off the handle like that excuse me I have to use the bathroom sure run up and pee when you should back me up now who's being paranoid just listen to yourself nobody else does I do need to get into David's computer he's gotta be hiding shit I bet David has all of his surveillance secrets in his laptop no shit it means a password how about step douche try again I need more clues Joyce might as well have wrote let's get married that might be a useful password score max the hacker strikes again whoa spoiler alert Rachel definitely hooked up with Frank but why does David care instead of stalking Kate David could have helped her this is so wrong Oh creepy bastard I better tell Chloe about this now it's just one more thing to make her sad and mad oh I should know the chloe can't get through an hour without creating drama nice breakfast David you're back already I have to take a nap after writing up vandalism reports last night what happened it's a little shit ass Punk's broke into the swimming pool this is what happens at these PC bullshit colleges entitled students taking over the campus do you know for sure it was Blackwell students who else would do it and I'm gonna bust them figures you'd be here is that your Rachel amber Halloween costume you know more about her than me no you and Chloe think you know more than anybody like all teenagers leave max alone David stop threatening students he threatens them with surveillance cameras so he can spy on everybody like he spies on all of us here don't start Chloe not now yeah I'm just always starting shit right you're a total paranoid thing not now Chloe you used to call me a loser for getting kicked out of Blackwell so who's the loser now David who haven't you accused or harassed between your investigations into Rachel and Kate what have you done besides get in trouble you're a bully David I saw you harass Kate Marsh when she was going through hell you could have totally helped her everybody at Blackwell is a suspect to you except for Nathan Prescott that's why the students and faculty don't like you you even threatened me I do respect your service but you don't respect anybody you're smoking pot in Chloe's room that's illegal so is spying on people in your family at your work why do you have photos of Kate Marsh and Rachel amber and your files anyway what is this true max yes David what do you have these files at all I find this very disturbing I do not have to take this kind of interrogation not from you punks maybe you should calm down oh you're turning on me now huh coarse women always stick together well screw you David you better go to a hotel until we figure this out you can't kick me out of my own home it's my home David paid for and in my name you know the law right oh I thought I knew a lot of things like when I'm outflanked have a nice day Chloe for once just please shut up I hope Joyce doesn't hate me for tearing into David I don't want to see or hear you again max you've hurt me and my family enough max don't beat yourself up David earned this all by himself understand max that gave me chills and you better not remind this one listen when I went through David's laptop I found pictures of Rachel and Frank being more than friends right no way that's she was just posing to tease Frank if you're not gonna believe me why don't we check out what Frank asin's our fee what's that gonna prove Frank has Rachel's bracelet what else does he have in there motherfucker better not have anything for his sake let's check the door Frank it's so wasted he sometimes forgets to lock it I can't believe you hung out with him not anymore we have to be casual ninjas here shit balls okay here's the plan I'll go to the diner and distract Frank by telling him I have this money but he needs to come with me then you come in in a wine so Frank doesn't see me then you can tell Frank he needs to check out his RV and then you rewind after you get the key and Chloe I got this I'll be right back don't let my epic plan get in the way of yours I'll try to scrounge up a Scooby Snack to distract his mangy mutt now to find a quick and easy way to snag Frank's keys look at all these flyers it's so sad that nobody will read them good morning how are the fish today don't ask first the snow and Eclipse what's next the tornado you don't think it could be like climate change or something climate sure has changed around here just saw that Prescott

ass about truckers or real work oh so you must have known her too only from the diner she was just a gold digger she belongs in California with all those you know who know what's good riddance but you can take pictures of my truck anytime take care so ominous I hate seeing old women on the street like their nice world hi how are you I remember you I heard about that girl almost jumping off the Blackwell roof Kate Marsh I was able to actually talk her down from the roof that was you if I had a bottle she is Thanks wish I had a bottle for you but I need to find out who else is involved in this I'm probably a biggest snoop than you people pretend to not see me so I see everybody and everything including Nathan Prescott that spoiled shit finally got kicked out of his daddy's school he also drugged the girl who tried to jump sounds like you know a lot more than me child I just think Arcadia Bay is in trouble maybe you could like to tell me what you're hiding I feel like I can trust you as much as Chloe and you wouldn't think I'm crazy too late for me to judge anybody plus you're not crazy I'm just gonna say this I had a vision of Arcadia Bay being destroyed by a tornado for real

guess Kate Marsh will be the face of Blackwell for a while and you for helping her that's the kind of school spirit we need more of I feel like David Madsen represents Blackwell not for long he's a loose cannon we all respect him for his service but he's too eager he's eager to be a dick to me and Chloe that's true he was ranting about a stolen gun then I tuned out somebody's always out to get him okay I do for you max do you think Arcadia Bay is a weird town I'd take a normal city with normal problems about now makes me sick thinking about it I thought Nathan Prescott represents Blackwell don't make me backwash this bacon you know what the Prescotts represent taking over Arcadia Bay you're not far wrong max I heard the Prescotts are working on some new big land deals mr. Prescott helped out my family once so while ago so I made a deal with him that I can't seem to get out of man if I could get one instant replay in life I better finish my breakfast first okay dude I'd take it well I heard a rumor you were working for the Prescott family on the side Jesus doesn't this town ever shut up I don't blame you for getting extra work look sometimes I check up on the

black room you mean Rachel amber when was the last time you talked to her uh never I just read about her in the news I didn't even know her name you did this is such a different world than when we were kids isn't it afterthat snow and eclipse that's more like the end of the world don't say that I'm not trying to bum you out it just seems like Arcadia Bay is having a meltdown I know things seem out of control but as long as we're together I don't feel afraid hanging out with you makes me feel like a total kid again you don't even know listen Chloe I'm sorry I haven't been not to see you more that was wrong you're my best friend max thanks for coming out to see me dude you're doing awesome I don't think so um my nose is getting cold maybe we should get back to my place it is hella cold out here hello I hate that word no offense none taken it's a pretty high-tech layer feels with a high-tech cell but I am lucky my parents bust their ass to take care of me I know it's hard for them they're grateful you are here with them right especially when they can't even take a walk alone sometimes I act like a total teenage brat just to give them an excuse to yell at me pathetic you know Chloe you're a great daughter you're kind and sensitive when you don't even have to be trust me I still get my rage on especially when a nurse has to watch while I take a dump so she can wipe my bum or when doctors flip me around like I was a science doll I can't even imagine but you're still amazing you always have been since we were kids thanks again for coming max I need to get my drink on can you can you bring me some water I should offer to put makeup on for Chloe not that I can but it would be fine drink up buttercup oh man no wonder my throat is dry I don't think I've talked this much the whole year have you ever thought about doing a podcast or something I wish I could punch your face right now a podcast dude I am a pod in a cast boring much it was just a thought I know you're just trying to help yeah that's become a bad habit of mine you sound like an adult now it seems like we were kids in another life what do you remember about us as kids we all have different memories I think about us as little pirates running and jumping through Arcadia Bay me too but we're still pirates in our own way Yeah right check me out Chloe of the Caribbean no way will I get on a fucking boat now unless you're with me as you can see I can't keep all my other friends away which friends did you hang out with the most Megan Weaver but you don't know her she was cool but after my accident she was too cool for school I know I wasn't around much no excuses I'm a loser but I am trying to make things right how dude you're not super max and I'm not trying to guilt trip you that's all my parents are for I know this is a dumb question but are you lonely here yes dumb question I don't mind being alone I can't exactly go party like a rock star though or get an 18 trouble with the folks I think Joyce and William are incredible max the accident has been so hard on them our insurance sucks and the medical bills are fucking insane can he pay all the bills no way they keep the numbers away from me but it doesn't take much research to find out I'm costing my parents almost a million dollars a year Chloe you're priceless uh no pun intended you're such a geek that's why I love you of course I know a geek when I be one see I'm practically a human entertainment system it would be sweet to chill out together and watch a movie like when you'd spend the night at my house what do you want to watch uh I think I'm in like a mellow Bladerunner mood I always cry at the end plus you know I always wanted to have cool colored bangs like Priss I know you would look incredible with blue hair now let's get this show on the road and you better not fall asleep on me like you always do when we watch movies I remember max I swear I won't fall asleep not when you're here not yet max is so cool that you're here again um haha here's the DVD you I cannot believe  fell asleep so fast how dare you I know you were beat down after the day with me and Blade Runner is a pretty dreamy movie to watch at night do you think that good is a replicant sorry I can see you're not wide-awake like me no I'm sorry I crashed so hard were you okay I do have a mother and father when you're not falling asleep on me you are a bitch in the morning it's the company I keep yesterday was such a blast it was great seeing you I know things were different and we were just dorky kids but being with you made me feel like when we were little pirates jumping and running through the forests again it meant a lot to me just to chill out with you and bullshit fuck I'm getting my regular head pains can you pretty please go upstairs and get my my morphine injector in the bathroom morphine injector it's it's total Star Trek shit you can't even see the needle seriously I need it um my parents keep the swag upstairs because they think I can't get to it but you can max like a pirate right I'm on it Chloe these whales are just a preview of the tornado to come and the Prescott Foundation Jesus Rachel amber is even missing in this reality I guess I can't change everything yeah they might get their own home taken away because of medical bills that's terrible hey William um am i bothering you y-yes max I love going through bills getting how can you bother me I haven't seen you in forever I know you look exactly the same it's so cool good or I'd be as scared if I didn't look like me of course you seem more adult now so what's on your mind I don't know how to say this but I'm truly sorry about what happened to Chloe me too all it takes is a few minutes to change a girl's whole life but she's alive she's been a trouper she is amazing I'm so glad you're here to help her and be your father I'm so glad Joyce is here to help us both max I just hate to think of what would happen to Chloe if I wasn't here William I just want you to know that whatever happens I'll always be here for Chloe always I know you will max being around do you enjoy such Ennis so nostalgic very old school as they say I think it's great for Chloe to see you makes Joyce happy too so it's not all bad news in Arcadia Bay or is it I was reading about that missing girl Rachel amber oh yes she went to Blackwell right oh poor thing it's a real nightmare for a family I get scared thinking about Chloe and that we might lose her someday the Prescott family might be bad news what do you think about them evil next question sounds like you know them well more than I want to uh choice has to work for those greedy bastards at Bama states I don't even like to think about it what do you think is going on with all of this crazy weather and animals throwing nobody knows right it is Nostradamus type shit pardon my french but all I actually care about now is Chloe and Joyce my family I was impressed by Chloe's room and all the high-tech equipment you should be we could buy a few mansions for what it all costs insurance helps but I don't know max I know it must be hard on you guys financially his bills are more like crushing we have to mortgage our home and that's pretty scary but but we'll get through it price is always right get it well I have to go see if Chloe needs anything it was so great talking with you again you act like it's the last time and please keep me from these bills whenever you want oh sure that's great they finally went to Paris hello again William so you finally made it to Paris oui as they say not me because I can't speak French but it was a great experience especially for Chloe I can see her loving it there you guys rock for going on a family adventure like that she talked about going to school there but that's not practical anymore it's not fair max I have to go see if Chloe needs anything here it is I never thought I'd be delivering morphine to my best friend max it is so nice to have you around no I didn't realize how bad Chloe's entry really was hmm Joyce used to hate smokers in the diner good morning max oh you and Chloe has so much quiet and now than when you were kids I remember it's nice waking up in your house again Oh William and I love it finally seeing you and Chloe together after all these years after the accident I wish I was a better friend I know Chloe doesn't get many visitors Oh max you're Chloe's best friend for a reason you all hear exactly when she needs you who helps Chloe out when you guys are at work we have a series of revolving nurses and caretakers Chloe still causes trouble even if she can't move max Chloe's condition is not improving her respiratory system is very weak and she she do you know what I'm saying Joyce I'm so sorry you have to go through all this bad or good I embrace every moment with my daughter and my husband this is what it means to be a family and we'll always be one no matter what how are you doing Joyce I'm doing the best I can max I won't lie it's difficult but nobody said life was easy here in Arcadia Bay do you know somebody named David Madsen he might hang out at the two wheels well that was random yeah he's a bus driver he comes in sometimes cue quiet why oh I was just curious you always were nice to see that everything doesn't change so what do you think is going on here with all of this eco havoc maybe Arcadia Bay just wants to be left alone I know the feeling honestly I don't give a shit about too much outside our house I don't blame you a choice except now we have dead birds and beech whales outside our front door so maybe I should care for Khloe's sake plus you guys have to work too bill and I have no time for ourselves and we're working more than we're living I even had to take a part-time gig at pan estates look do you know the Prescotts I know that Sean Prescott won't be happy until he owns everything in Arcadia Bay stay away from his son Nathan I have to tell you how much I loved seeing you and William together again he's been such a hero through all this Chloe and I lucky to have him Chloe and Williams seem like they still get along so good yeah those two are closer now more than ever Chloe will actually listen to William well she usually ignores me oh it's so cute when they gang up on poor ol me you rule choice shit things would be different if I did I

vortex Club parties with Kate and Rachel and see whatever hidden shed he's gotten his messages three beats step douche dad until he tells us about Frank Nathan and the dark room and I do have a gun

you're here I'm doing even better I'm so grateful to you for coming up to the roof to talk me down max I felt so lost and alone when I saw how much you cared how hard you were trying you made me realize I wasn't alone Thank You Kate there are so many people who love you and want to help you I know you should see all the letters and postcards I gave most of the flowers to other patients here because they need them more than me and keeping their balloons though one of the nurses gave me some pen and paper so I could do some drawings I love your illustrations they got kind of dark there for

book why is that subtle you better take the pictures max I'm going to be here for another day until my family comes out to visit how are they treating you like they need to protect me forever they're

you are giving me a headache No Deal Frank we didn't come here to fight this is so much bigger than us you you come in peace after you aimed a fuckin gun at me and then pulled the trigger to be honest Frank you're scared you held a knife on my friend I didn't want to pull the trigger I could tell by the way you held that pop gun with both hands like it was a magnum maybe I shouldn't have brought that knife to a gunfight I only want to shoot with my camera I swear ask Chloe look Frank max does need a gun anyway so are we cool please okay we're cool for now but my dog isn't and if you try any shit he will bite your head off he's done it before we're only here to talk I wouldn't mess with your dog shit you wouldn't have time you like dogs of course I do I heard you even rescued a bunch of fight dogs that's amazing no all right it was just the right thing to do I couldn't stand to see those poor animals treated like like slaves that's how I came to own Papa dude that's very cool Frank your dog is lucky you came home maybe we can focus on rescuing Rachel now Rachel is that why you're really here yes we're so close to finding her now Frank we need all the help we can get now especially from you you and Chloe do not know Rachel like I did and I couldn't even help her you're in way over your heads why don't you just go play in your Clubhouse Rachel said she gave you one of her favorite photos that proves how much she cares and you care that's why you have to help other hell did you know about that photo that's my favorite picture of her I can look at it any time and she'll always be there for me I can't stand not knowing where she is not hearing her voice or her laugh anymore we can change all that it's up to you help us find her Frank please we really need your client list well if there is a chance in hell you two dorks can find Rachel and I'll take it my dog isn't barking at you so I guess that's a good sign thank you yeah thanks Frank seriously it's hard to take you character seriously but I want to good luck that was cool Frank gave up the code to help us Rachel must have seen something good in him Chloe are you okay I'm glad things worked out okay with Frank it's nice to have one less enemy in Arcadia Bay amen to that I better focus on this board and start tying these clues together sorry we got Frank on our side without using you let's look at Frank's drug deals during the week of the party yes the game is on now talk to us a count book tell us everything let's see if I can find any deal Frank made with needs another vortex club oh yes these are all the times in places for Frank and Nathan's deals that's it hit max thanks to David's own investigation I should be able to find out what Nathan did during the party's week and that's all she wrote please let me friend something close about Nathan in here crate now how do I find out which car is Nathan's to match the coordinates oh yes now we're finally getting somewhere Chloe let's plug in these numbers and see if they lead to an actual address aye aye captain here we come Rachel I have to analyze Nathan's messages what could help me unlock this phone okay max let's blow this coat up and go home let's start hacking Oh score now let's check out all the messages from the week Kate was drugged yes this is all about Nathan trying to score for the vortex club party Nathan was jonesing hard the night of the party he didn't have enough drugs drug dealer drama God Nathan you're out of control so it was you now I can officially call you a psycho stalker no Nathan it's time for you to watch out asshole is this from Nathan's father that's brutal take a breath max go through all this data and you can find out where Nathan took Kate after the party max there's no logical link between those clues if I can match one of the text messages and transactions with Frank then I can find the exact location this is like goddamn math I suck looks like this isn't the right combination since Kate left the party early with Nathan I should search for texts and locations and transactions in the evening those clues are not related this makes no sense max max just match the right text message with the right account maybe I should try to link other clues together Chloe this is definitely the place let me dig up some more clothes here nope nothing max there's nothing here there's a shitty old barn let's keep searching and find out who owns this haunted barn I'm on this hold on somebody named Harry Aaron Prescott I'm shocked should we call the police fuck that you know the police here like Nathan's private security right that's so messed up as you've noticed this whole town is messed up we can't trust anybody except each other so we have to go out to that farmhouse by ourselves I was afraid you'd say that we could call Warren since she kicked Nathan's ass it's just the two of us nobody else and I'm not scared at all you have the power I feel like we're this close to finding Rachel we have to find her max we will but remember my power isn't infinite we still have to be careful do you hear Chloe yes sir wait this is scary I know but we're here I was gonna find the best way in whoa check this out fresh tire tracks dude somebody was just here then we need to get in that barn Chloe I found the front door come on oh yes Maximus rules god this is way too blur

most expensive printer in the world that son of a bitch talk about tortured let's see what's in here oh my god no whoa what is going on between Nathan and his father oh yeah school suspension is a deal breaker in the Prescott family that's an original signed illustration fits perfect in here needles crows this must be the crap that Nathan gets from Frank somebody likes their whiskey these newspapers are all about Rachel and Kate everything is sketchy as fuck nothing about Rachel here so who's using this fancy tripod I've never seen so much pricey equipment before what's with the Prescotts and creepy art ah the apocalypse entertainment system come on let's see what this shit is all about we are okay a binder marked Victoria but it's empty look the next one says Kate oh no Kate

vortex club party Rachel this can't be real he's our all he's old post shots right right Chloe look at her face she's out of it maybe maybe Nathan hate her a shitload of cash to do this she probably would have I don't think so why is he putting her in the ground like that where the junkyard max we have to find that spot now then we can see what he did there's no way she's dead no way she posed

Jefferson doesn't talk that way in and he's famous on point max thanks for admitting again that I have some talent not that I think I always do I don't either but that's the choice you make hard to believe but I don't always make the best choices do you think it's like they we're not supposed to be friends why the hell not we're both into art and photography both kind of weird and pretentious if we hung out with our attitude we get along fine I almost asked you to hang out you said my photos were Avedon esque then I remembered who I was you should have asked me it would have been cool to compare photo notes maybe we're too much alike you might be right well max Caulfield there's still time for you to get in the vortex club I actually hope so Victoria why do you say it like that Victoria listen to me your life is in serious danger I know Nathan is your friend but he is truly unstable and dangerous he did drugged Kate at that party so he could take her someplace dark what nice try max but I don't believe you and why would he do that that I don't know yet but it was enough to make Kate want to die and I think you're next max that is crazy nathan is like one of my best friends yes he takes serious meds but that's not his fault his family treats him like a total freak just because he has little meltdowns they're not little anymore they're deadly I don't care if you hate me or not but you have to believe me you could have been a major bitch to me when I got hit without paint and I deserved it max I don't hate you I actually think you're one of the coolest people I Blackwell weird but cool you just don't know what yet maybe I'm jealous because you don't give a shit what anybody thinks and I do to be honest nathan has been freaking me out lately he's not here and I haven't seen just make sure you stay away from hair and stick close to your friends tonight okay I let you boss me around this one time and I have other people that can go to for protection thanks for telling me this max if what you said is true then you be careful too I've got my own protection um text me if you need anything I will thanks tutoria our gua maybe there's hope yet for Victoria hiding me I'm glad I warned her I hope she's okay there you are Chloe Nathan isn't here nobody has seen him tonight he's definitely not upstairs or in the lockers damn maybe he's hiding in his dorm and let's bail Nathan can't hide anymore so you made it max oh hey mr.

      "previously on life is strange what did you find Rachel in the darkroom over and over that's it we can't trust anybody except each other you know more about her than me no you and Chloe think you know more than anybody like all teenagers oh look the Wonder Twins what are you doing in my dorm you are so fucking dead Ethan is truly psychotic I know he has something to do with Rachel missing he wasn't the first all those binders are filled with other victims what are you doing here Mack Victoria has to be next what a lame gimmick Rachel why is he putting her in the ground like that where the junkyard next we have to find that spot now sorry Chloe I'm so sorry I know you're close to Nathan but your life is in serious danger Nathan just texted me he says there won't be any evidence left after he's done oh god max look she's still there you Chloe why darkroom is anybody out there please help oh shit Jefferson kidnaps Victoria - this is so bad haha finally I'm free almost Victoria wake up wake up god I don't remember anything that happened this must be the same drug Nathan used on a cane of course and right in front of me great I can see all my things but I can't grab it I can't know if it towards me oh shit that's me he took that shot last night Hey looking at myself like that you'll pay for this Jefferson I promise I would never go back in time like this again but this is the only way max this angle highlights for purity seek the slightly unconscious model is often the most open and honest no vanity or posing just pure expression of Christ look at that perfect face hope that stare there stay still Oh max you fucked up my shot but please don't worry we have all the time in the world for now I knew you were special the second I saw your first selfie yes I still hate that word but I loved the purity of your own image not like Rachel who was always looking in the wrong places poor Rachel wait let me try this angle don't move much better thanks max if only Nathan could see this setup he tried so hard but you can't just throw a few subjects around and expect a cohesive style or thinking but he had an eye for shadows and an eye for a whole lot more as his elite family will find out along with Arcadia Bay nice good love those eyes that's just too bad you're so goddamn nose max but this room is under 24/7 surveillance so all I had to do was text you from Nathan's phone and you fell right into my hands you really should have focused on schoolwork not private detecting your little friend Chloe right yeah I'm sorry that I killed that Nathan killed her in self-defense but she had a troubled history like most Arcadia Bay dropouts nobody will be surprised or Kane though I promise people will care when you died a night max I wasn't lying when I said you have a gift okay now this looks good maybe a few more close-ups max please do not move so much I need you pose and frames my way maybe a new dose will come home now don't move or this will hurt much stupid bitch you just don't listen do you in fact he never did hear much in my class if you had you might have seen all this coming god damn you are a fighter I've had my eye on you and I've noticed that you've been more fearless this week than maybe your whole life remember my number one always take a shot oh Jesus I can't believe that happened so sick wait Jefferson couldn't handle stains on his photos good now I can use them know that picture isn't going to help and I can't go through all that again I won't I really like to smash that fancy camera and did Jefferson's face okay I broke those files when I kicked the trolley Victoria hey Victoria it's max can you hear me max oh god where are we oh what's happening you've been drugged like Kate and me do you remember how you got here no I don't know you warned me he warned me about Nathan then went to Jefferson for help and he was acting so weird I saw last thing I remember and I can't move my head listen carefully mark Jefferson kidnapped us he's using Nathan as well Jefferson is very dangerous so we have to get out of here before he comes back max he just can't believe this is real I don't want to die like this just hold on Victoria nobody is gonna die anymore max what's going on I thought you said Nathan was dangerous but it was actually mark mr. Jefferson I was wrong I should have known that Nathan couldn't do all this on his own do what what's going to happen to us oh please get us out of here I'm not going to let that asshole get away with this I just I need you to be strong I can't do this alone we need to act while we're clear-headed if he tosses us again we'll forget everything not you not strong max look at me look what I did to Kate Marsh no she's in the hospital and I'm here Kate wants us to get the hell out of here and then we can both go see her again okay I do anything just see Kate once more just to tell her I'm sorry Victoria we will find a way to escape I promise max I believe you please please get us out of here max whoa I'm definitely more awake in this photo I could try this one this might work please work I'm getting some spectacular images here max yes Victoria would kill to be in your place but she doesn't understand our connection you're the winner max I choose you your portrait fucks you you're trying too hard I know you're scared you all have the same doe-eyed look when you wake up here replaced by fears you realize what's about to happen mr. Jefferson why are you doing this oh thanks I'm so glad you asked that question simply put I'm obsessed with the idea of capturing that moment innocence evolves into corruption that shift from black to white to gray and beyond most models are cynical they lose that naivete however some Blackwell students carry their hope and optimism with them like an aura and those lucky few become my models my subjects yes you're a psychopath and this is your last session Oh contraire max I'm so saying that nobody knows what's happening to you right now as you can see sleeping beauty here is too harsh for my gentle lens and don't get me started on your late partner I had enough of those folk Punk sluts in my Seattle days you killed Chloe you murdered my best friend she had a loaded weapon this was clearly self-defense but that's what happens when you play with guns or try to fuck with me it's better when they don't know like pure sweet okay Kate believed and she survived you failed to break her she's stronger than ever and she'll outlive you she'll certainly outlive you who knows maybe I'll pay Kate a visit soon and test her faith again you will not get away with this I want you to know that too bad you already made a convincing argument against Nathan in the principal's office thank you so much for setting him up for me I do know that the Prescotts are going to have a major scandal when the town finds out what their elite son has been doing for homework he's as sick as you don't judge people max but that's why Nathan never should have been at Blackwell that makes two of you I help Nathan realize his vision so few people get that chance you brainwashed him I became a sort of father figure for Nathan it happens often and teacher-student relationships it was kind of touching for a while did you tell him everything about your plans at blackwell don't be stupid max I told him what he needed to hear in return I had access to the Prescott fortune who do you think paid for this glorious darkroom and equipment how else could I get all these hip new drugs for my subjects Rachel amber was your victim not your subject Rachel amber hmm that's the real tragedy Nathan thought he could be an artist like me instead the dumbass gave her an overdose Chloe and Rachel you killed both of them they're fucking together in heaven right now is that what you want to hear why why why why start listening to me you don't cunt I'm sorry max and that was not cool anyway Rachel is dead but no tears Los Angeles would have killed her anyway so look at this as a favor you're evil oh I see you and your friends almost beat Nathan to death see we're not so different yes yes we are I cared more about Nathan than you did no you didn't it's just too bad that he fell in lust with Rachel he actually thought he could mimic what I do with the camera and subjects like father but not like son where is Nathan no dead and buried after what he did to Rachel I knew I couldn't keep him as a protege for much longer now the police will never find his body do you finally get it now max I can't compromise my vision with amateurs you are an amateur look at the trail of death you left behind you can't blame all this on Nathan I don't care what you do to me you're gonna die motherfucker for Chloe and Rachel and everybody else I do love your spirit max but you brought yourself here by your own choice anyway I like my models to be seen and not heard so I have to make sure there's nothing left behind of you okay now let's see how these shots came out I can see why your instant camera is so appealing you don't need a computer to print your work out I have all those photos in my diary this could be a way out wait please mr. Jefferson max I would love to talk shop but I really need to go over these pictures especially while they're fresh in my mind I think our session was a career high for me what what are you going to do to me I'm going to make you live forever in my photographs that's all that will be left of Maxine Caulfield they won't even find your bag wait let me go and I'll help you let me help you please don't beg never beg I hate that anyway let's enjoy our final moment before I have to end our memorable session with your death wait could you could you show me the photos that's the first time one of my models down here has asked me that of course you would but I love that the last thing you'll ever see is yourself through my camera hi - perfect what you you still have my diary don't worry nobody's going to read it thanks for reminding me there's nothing more innocent than a teenager's diary oh look at your selfies what a waste of talent look at that shot max you can do so much better I could frame any one of you in a dark corner and capture you in a moment of desperation I believe max has taken what you kids call a selfie a dumb right back where I started this insane week and nobody was going to hurt Chloe laughter I can't Orchard has been popular since the early 1800s your generation was not the first to use images for selfie expression sorry I couldn't resist the point remains that the portraiture has always been a vital aspect of art and photography for as long as it's been around now max since you've captured our interest and clearly want to join the conversation can you please tell us the name of the process that gave birth to the first self-portraits who cares this class is hella bullshit I'll pretend you didn't say that and let you try to answer one more sorry there's no time left I mean your class is almost over oh well thanks for the warning max so the daguerreian process made ports which are quite popular mainly because it gave the subjects clear defined features you can learn more when you finish reading the assigned chapters clearly max doesn't have the time hey guys don't forget the deadline to submit a photo in the everyday heroes to change time to San Francisco where you'll be feted by the arse let's make it real easy to capture market Jeffress on get it together Taylor don't hide I'm still waiting for your entry - and yes max I see you pretending not to see bastard I have to warn David about Jefferson and the darkroom did you know suddenly your pictures would actually alter time and space I hope I still love photography when this is done don't confuse the art with the artist bastard this diary literally saved my life all I need is David's number and Jefferson is one text closer to life without parole I've got a ton of Blackwell brochures so I hope David's number is in there I should be able to track down David's number from the school pamphlet found you for once David I'm praying 'll overreact to this as much as everything else and take Jefferson down fast you wanted me to enter the contest asshole so maybe I'll be going to San Francisco in Jefferson you'll be going to prison it's the past within the past am i pushing myself too hard Victoria it's nice to know how you really feel it doesn't matter what happens to me I have to save Chloe I'm happy to fix it so you'll be here to get your fancy camera Victoria poor Kate hi Kate oh hey max Kate listen to me I am always remember that you're not alone I've got your back no matter what happens so do a lot of other people we all care we're all here for you you need to know that what that makes me feel so blessed for the first time this week uh I don't know what to say that's okay neither do I maybe we could both use her hug Thanks you always know the right thing to do this is the last time somebody bullies you Kate at least Kate knows people have her back I still feel like the lighthouse is calling out to me Victoria I'm sorry you have to stand next to that psycho I see right through your bullshit Jefferson everybody else will too I'd like to bust this up right now mr. Jefferson We Need to Talk can you see I'm talking to mr. Jefferson now yes I see but maybe you shouldn't uh and why not hold on Victoria are you okay max I will be when Victoria understands that hiding behind a screen posting videos of people is incredibly cruel and unfair you're smart enough to know how easy it is to hurt somebody to destroy their life I just want you to think about how much it would hurt if somebody did that to you you can always make the right choice Victoria I know you've got a good heart I've seen it listen I I didn't you don't have to explain there's no reason for you to be so insecure that you can't be happy with your own talent wouldn't it be better to lift people up than to bring them down you could inspire people okay I don't know what you're talking about now do i mr. Jefferson I think I should stay out of this one Victoria then I guess I'm done talking that's okay too that was kind of random acts what did you mean here's my photograph for the everyday heroes contest oh that was easy no it wasn't easy at all well I uh I can't prejudge yet but I'm very happy you decided to enter that means a lot to me and black well the first step for any artist is to put themselves out there in the world without fear to be innocent or guilty well thanks for the photo and maybe both of us will be jet-setting to San Francisco this Friday maybe only one of us will be going don't be so modest max anything can happen in a week as you're going to find out mr. Jefferson whoa okay you're okay max you're safe on a plane I hope I did everything right this time good work David Chloe oh you're alive oh you're Allah I did it I fixed everything wowser we're almost in San Francisco I'm so stressed but I'm so excited - it's so weird to be in between realities everything is out of focus into the distance I can't wait to live in Frisco nobody calls it Frisco so I have to admit I love being called an artist ha I haven't seen hot dog man and forever Khloe and I used to totally play the video game and watch him all the time when we were innocent the beginning of the end for Jefferson and the Prescotts please fasten your seat and stow any electronic gear until the plane is on the ground and at the gate thank you we're starting our descent in a few minutes it's a beautiful day in San Francisco it's clear skies and cool 60 degrees we hope you enjoyed your trip and we thank you very much for choosing pacific west air come fly with us any time oh I don't think so I'm hoping these airline seats get smaller so I won't have to fly at all anymore I bet this is a nice break for principal Wells after all the damage control you had to do this week at blackwell how did you sleep oh boy it wasn't snoring out loud max just a bit it's been a tough week at blackwell so I hope you'll forgive me between mr. Jefferson Prescott's things have been hectic to say the least I totally get it principal Wells that's a smart way of telling me to stop whining we are proud of you for representing Blackwell at the everyday heroes contest I know I'm not exactly the guy you wanted in San Francisco but we all want you to have a great experience here I already am and we're not even there oh Christ another nosebleed max you're not just screwing around with time San Francisco is so cool and this gallery is huge so is the buffet even event skimps on the food you know it's a bad event as long as I don't have to eat me caviar this is your day max you can do whatever you want I hope you take advantage of your status and talk to as many influential people here as possible work the room I don't know I feel so weird like I'm a little kid hanging with you at all tacks after this week you are certainly not a little kid anymore in fact you're a noteworthy adult being honored by your peers now you have to start acting like the photographer you want to be helped I wanted to be in charge of a big school someday so I started taking charge of things when I was young ask my poor classmates max I'm gonna eat up that caviar so you don't have to better get in there and start schmoozing you know I won't always be here to take charge but you come talk to me whenever you want come on max after everything that's happened this should be the least scary thing you've ever done how's our max you did it somehow I went from the darkness great to read all these comments even the mean ones aren't you from Blackwell Academy I wanted to go there but I didn't get in they have such a cool program I beg your learning a lot look at this breath it was cool that principal Wells came along he could have canceled our injuries after what happened with Jefferson Champaign makes me think of me and Chloe getting busted with that wine so how are you handling your new fame as a photographer I don't feel like a famous photographer yet every journey starts with the first step I'm only a Blackwell bureaucrat not an artist but you've made us proud with the great response to your work so far I don't know I'm just lucky there's no way I'm a real photographer yet don't sell yourself short max maybe I felt guilty for celebrating leave that to me I I should have been more proactive about Kate Marsh in her awful situation she's strong and I'm glad she made it out of that hell I should have put my foot down with Nathan Prescott or put my foot in his ass mark Jefferson was good about hiding his tracks we were all fooled by him most of all me as you might know I have a weakness for prestige and Jefferson had such a great reputation nobody expected him to be so disturbed I couldn't believe the police found those sick photos in his darkroom those poor girls at least he's in jail along with Nathan for kidnapping and murder and Sean Prescott is now under serious investigation for all his years of corruption money and power can only protect you for so long at Arcadia Bay the irony is there for once Sean Prescott actually had no clue what was going on with Jefferson and he even brought him to Blackwell I'd like to think there's some karma involved the Prescotts have had this coming I do believe that what goes around comes around I just hope it's all good for a change I'm hoping this is a fresh start principal wells like I said before you're an adult now max you can call me ray Oh at least for this event now if you'll excuse me I hear the buffet calling me again excuse me max I have to go call my wife and how do these galleries afford to rent here god I love art you must be the everyday euro from black well my name is Lauren Francis and I run the media department at Detroit School of Visual Arts I'd love to talk about you being a residency next spring don't say anything to principal Wells yet that is different loving the retro vibe I wonder if I can buy these everyday heroes

god no I'm back here again I thought I fixed everything what did you say max what Jefferson should be in jail not here Jesus it's like you're back in my class you're still spacing out it might be cool

developed from nerd to hero within a week there's something weird going on with you whoa did you see how crazy it is outside like I said something weird there's that fear it's an honor working with you on these final sessions I hope these images will be appreciated for what they truly capture the loss of youth at least that's the last lecture you'll ever have to hear from me and I promise you no one knows bleeds Jefferson please don't do that you don't know what's happening she's quiet quiet max please don't do this I promise this final dose won't hurt what David no Jesus David Matz he's out

Jefferson now it's your turn to be captured in a moment save Chloe he burned everything including all of my photos Warren yes I can use that picture he took of us shit no signal thanks mr. Jefferson but you won't need this anymore good god it's a studio just looking at that makes me want to vomit ah I wanna burn all these photos I hate looking at me like that damn Jefferson torch to everything now the only photo I can get is the one Warren took oh that's Victoria's bracelet I bet Jefferson was going to use that to frame Nathan Jefferson looks so he was this pathetic now Oh Chloe I'm gonna save you for the last time there's no way I'm leaving your necklace here's Frank isn't a bad person but he can't be in denial about the drugs he provided how is this place David Madsen is on the case he's still looking for evidence David are you okay look at this place it feels like hell Jefferson was oh it's gonna kill me like he did to Victoria chase Oh No I always suspected that son of a bitch you kind of suspected everybody yes and this is what I get from wasting all those hours on the Prescotts I set my sights too wide lack of focus I know the feeling I wasn't surprised when you accused Nathan drugging Kate Marsh and I thought so too and Max I treated Kate like shit I know she's a good person but I'm not and I hope I get to tell her that soon Kate was bullied up to that roof but it was still Nathan and Jefferson who put her there I knew Nathan Prescott was a threat I just waited too long to neutralize him Jefferson already did they had some weird father-son thing going on but Nathan killed Rachel and Jefferson had to use him as a scapegoat that pervert was pulling all this shit right into my nose too I could've stopped him in Nathan if only I wasn't so stupid no I told principal Wells Nathan had a gun and almost used it but he didn't want to believe me I should have been more loud we all make decisions we regret but I have to admit I'm impressed by you and Chloe and your investigation I had all the high-tech toys well you had each other maybe she learned from you I think she only learned how to hate my guts you both had a tough start and I know it wasn't easy I'm not gonna make any excuses for my behavior I tried to be a good soldier but I wasn't so great I tried to be a good father too but when Joyce kicked me out I had nothing I'm so sorry about that I didn't want that to happen I should never have set up those surveillance cams kept all those files I'm going to tell Joyce I was wrong about you she does love you it's pretty obvious I try not to use my service as an excuse but it's hard to come home after war most people don't know or care what it's like except choice she gave me hope a new life and you saved mine Chloe is she she would be proud of you I just want to see her safe with her mother I promise Joyce I would go see a family counselor and I'll start by apologizing to Chloe I don't expect her to call me dad but maybe she'll stop calling me step douche so where is Chloe David um but she was pretty stressed out so she went to go medicate before I ended up in here so she's okay oh thank god for once I'm happy Chloe's a STONER David I have to go outside and get some real air and use my phone of course go on max your brave soldier I'm glad Chloe has a best friend like you gone now you've seen enough of this room okay teacher let's see what kind of photo evidence you shit all over this computer you're not getting away with this Jefferson no more fucking guns your thoughts Jefferson every song you hear in jail will be torture you'll never be free again freedom I wish when would you find yes Warren can you hear me never mind listen do you have that photo you took place tonight in the parking lot yes it is and I want it where are you I'm on my way that's okay me too but it's not over yet wine to hold on I have been 43 years in our culture to sin and entitlement would lead to God striking us down and I'm the one trapped in this fucking radio station you have one new message message received yesterday and 9 p.m. max its Nathan I just wanted to say I'm sorry I didn't want to hurt Kate or Rachel or didn't want to hurt anybody everybody me mr.

this so I just will Rachel is dead no please please no no not Rachel she can't fucking be yeah are you sure I mean how do you know we use the names you gave us to track down a farmhouse my professor Mark Jefferson has this creepy photo torture room and we found out he was using Nathan Prescott to drug and photograph Blackwell students hi Scott fuck fuck I knew it I should never have hooked up with that sick pug pompidou hated him you saw he said Rachel yes I wish I did it I'm so so sorry Frank Nathan wanted to impress Jefferson and he he killed her how hmm how did he kill her he used some dragon gave her an overdose no four dose the only way Nathan could have done that is if I saw the damn I killed my lioness no what have I done where is this motherfucker Jefferson he's going to jail he won't be hurting anybody anymore Rachel aah she was the one good thing in my life max I know she was TV on me I expect her to leave me just it's not how it happened I would never have stopped her from going after her dreams I know neither were Chloe died new Chloe her clothes now he's jealous but and I see why Rachel Duggar and Chloe was mad enough to ask me for help after all that shit we went through Chloe would appreciate you know at one time I met my dad the bastard quoted the Bible and said he wanted to enter his house justified in other words to do the right thing me too and maybe you're helping me get there max don't get me wrong kid I still think you're weird that you're cool like it's good to have Frank on our team actually I can't believe my reach like I can't talk right now all right come on max let's talk over here and give Frank some rest in space choice how are you doing just when I think I've already been through the wringer where's Chloe I I'll find her not in this storm you won't and you're not going out there max I just have to pray that Chloe and David hold up I'm sorry about all this choice don't be honey it's not like you whipped up this tornado on your own I mean I'm also sorry about everything with David you don't have control over any of that David is an adult and he has a lot more age and experience under his belt doesn't always show it I'm sorry I caused so many problems with David and Chloe you did the right thing David overstepped his bounds I had a suspicion he was taking his private surveillance way too seriously but he's sorry and I wish he was here right now I just want our lives to be normal again there's all this shit going on this week I think you're right and look at me trying to keep my family together yeah max did I make a mistake kicking David out David saved my wife from the storm I saw how much he cares about Chloe even if he couldn't show it David needs you more than ever and I can see why you love him I'm so happy David was there for you he has a lot of weight on his back from the war but he truly wants to help people he even agreed to take a family counseling class I'm sure that was a hard thing for him to do it shows how much he truly cares about you and Chloe nothing would make me happier than for David and Chloe to make peace not war I don't know what to do anymore I just I just want this storm to blow over forever maybe it's time we leave Arcadia Bay if we can David is a real hero choice I know that all he wants to do is make you happy I know he would do anything for you and Chloe I know and yes he's not William but that's okay he's not supposed to be you reminded me of when he came into my life I was ready to give up David's love gave me strength he even told me I was his hero and I can't give up loving him I wanted to come back home I hope I get to tell him that soon to you do you think this is it yeah look at Warren always trying to help I hate to say I'm glad to see you but I'm so glad to see you that's okay the important thing is that you're safe and I know you can take care of yourself after Nathan you should have done that a long time ago Dan max can't believe you actually drove down here in the middle of a fucking six tornado just for one photograph I mean I know you didn't come from me worried I came for all of you you just told me you do have the photograph I just want that shut up and listen oh yeah you're finally going to tell me what you never did in the parking lot I wish I would have so I'm just going to tell you without any explanation trust me okay I always do you should probably tell me quick I had a vision in Jefferson's class for tornado destroying Arcadia Bay I went to the bathroom and saw my best friend Chloe gets shot by Nathan Prescott you with me so far where else could I be go on then I found out that I cover wine time and long story short mark Jefferson is insane and dangerous oh is that all I have to go back in time Jefferson Artic killed Chloe I can't let that happen I have to do something Warren max went back in time is what caused the storm all because because of me how I'm not a real scientist even though I play one at school but this seems like pure cause and effect maybe chaos theory what happened with Jefferson did did he hurt you Nathan accidentally killed Rachel amber trying to impress Jefferson Nathan just needed mental help now he's dead and Jefferson is done Jesus max I want the whole story but I guess we really are out of time but I can still change things what do you think will happen for every action there's is a reaction whenever you reversed her or alter time maybe you caused a chain reaction even in the environment Laura no I know this all sounds insane but you're the only other person who I can count on now I wish we had more time together do you believe me max of course I believe you you're the most amazing person I've ever met and glad you trust me always I just wish I could trust my powers I guess we'll never know if it's magic or science even if it's from a wizard or a wormhole if you're part of something bigger I don't believe in fate or destiny but after this week I realize that I'm a shit that makes both of us words I do know you're here for a reason and I guess it's up to you to find out why max I'm sorry you got stuck in this and this I don't have a fucking clue what's going on but I have total faith that you'll do the right thing when the time comes I'm so proud of you max how could there be more important moment in history I have in the middle of it with you so thank you for trusting me thanks for being here always Hey be careful out there I could use a hug before I do this for me too better go before I get pathetic and tell you not to you're not pathetic you're one of my heroes and I'm going to make the right choices from now on I swear that's why your Supermax action we could've time for this shit come on max yeah Chloe Jesus dude what is up with you I'm just glad right here together I guess you need to talk no worries it's all good I'm glad you're with me too what's going on max we have to find Nathan right now he's gonna sorry Miranda but Rachael let's go now Chloe wait listen I can walk and listen okay stop and listen for once fine max I'm listening Chloe you can't go in that party you're gonna you couldn't die a few - you used your powers right and you fucked around with time and I died not like that you're supposed to back me up so there's no way that punk-ass bitch Nathan Prescott is taking me down you're right he won't Mark Jefferson killed you and others Jefferson the art teacher that's bullshit nathan is the fucking serial killer we saw the proof now excuse me I'm going to that party to make sure he never hurts anybody again are you coming Jason is dead and you're in danger that fucker is already dead how do you know that because I was there will you please tell me exactly what happened please mark Jefferson turned out to be a psychopath okay max let's go in there as a team and take his ass out right now Chloe Jefferson drugged and kidnapped me I was tied up in his punker you have no idea what he'll I went through to get back here I couldn't let you die you brought me back here and I can't lose you again I won't Maksim I'm so sorry I was the one who dragged you into all this shit nobody especially you should have to go through that I know we have to stop Jefferson with one bullet no not this way Chloe I I can't keep fixing everything if all I'm gonna do is just break it over and over again I know how this is gonna turn out and I'm afraid I'm fuckin up all these alternate realities wait alternate realities what do you mean max what did you do I fucked up Chloe I wanted to make things right but everything to her don't wrong max what the hell are you talking about I was able to go back in time to the last day William was alive I stopped him for leaving but but you ended up in a car crash instead you saw my dad again yeah you're completely paralyzed and you you were in pain you were slowly dying and you you asked me to end your life I did for you I didn't want you to suffer in any other timeline or reality I couldn't bear the thought of you in any more pain god max that must have been I must have been awful for you I'm so sorry I had to ask you that it was worse for you but I had no idea what would happen and as usual I messed everything up and I never wanna hurt you ever you have to believe me of course I do do you think I would even know how to handle that situation nobody would the important thing is that we're together again you're right that's that's why you should come with me so we can stay together stay alive I hear you max but do you think we should let Jefferson get away with torture and murder of course not if we tell David he'll believe us and he can actually stop him right I don't get it why do you trust him after you totally reamed him the other day he's not even at our house anymore Chloe David saved me from Jefferson if he didn't track down the darkroom I'd be dead right now max I had no clue I should have been the one to save you but I'm so grateful David was there so what's your plan we tell him everything including that Victoria is in danger okay you've been there so much I believe you max after all I'm still your faithful companion yes you are so listen in a few minutes I won't know any of this happened nothing we absolutely have to stay in your room and do nothing then we explain everything to David and we finally let him do his job you'll have to tell me exactly what I did inside just now just explain that I travel through time using the photo will you believe me I always believe you Chloe oh I see that the real max is back so how was your time trip dude oh you're alive you're alive both of us I did so much to bring you back home worked actually work it looks like even fate doesn't want us apart and travel through multiple realities just save my ungrateful ass over and open now it was born I don't blame you for watching me how does your life have to roll my drunk come on the official drama king and queen of Arcadia Bay this week look at what my powers have caused just a shrimp hunter nobody you're max fucking call time warrior even if you worried you're cutting and caring nobody could have a better bus you didn't ask for any of us to happen but it did you need to accept how awesome you are maybe I willed it subconsciously I always wanted my life to be special an adventure but not without you and it didn't happen so without you my powers wouldn't even exist and for whatever scientific mystical reason that were obviously never forgiven we were meant to be together at this exact moment in history I have to think the Rachel was somewhere behind the scenes fighting for justice I'd like to think that too we all owe Rachel amber not tell me everything that happened you remember right well we we left the party and made sure Jefferson couldn't find us for once I was glad I lived in an actual fortress when the storm got Paula crazy and and you said we would be safe at the lightness Chloe look storm is getting bigger now coming closer I can't even believe this is real this is happening because of me you stop it as they stop beating yourself up okay we've both paid our dues already moment that would sir who knows this could be Rachel's revenge our revenge the lighthouse is out of the way of the tornado come on we cook glory Wow Alfred Hitchcock famously called film little pieces of time these pieces of time can frame us in our glory so listen to this Jefferson lecture again this might be you now can you give me an example of a photographer perfect audition in black and white am I stuck in a time loop anybody Bueller Diane are be calm don't freak out why Arvest yeah images of hopeless faces I feel like totally haunted by the eyes of those sad mothers and children she saw humanity as George what's going on do you even care keep them to yourself seriously though I could frame any one of you in a dark corner and capturing a moment of desperation everybody's gone they'll have right totally fucked up time this doesn't make sense I don't care if this is a dream or a nightmare I'm taking this picture not yet you bastard you didn't die Kate you're alive oh that's too creepy Oh Rachel didn't deserve any of it is ICU max Caulfield don't even think about leaving here until we talk about your entry I just wanted to know if you'd like to spend the rest of your life in my dark room your purity inspires me so much and we could be so happy together who needs selfies when I can give you portraiture there's no way I'm saying that no way it's about time somebody finally killed Chloe think of how often that bitch almost got me killed it's like you're doing both of us an awesome favor Chloe can never appreciate you the way I will Maxine and yes I insist on calling you Maxine forever this can't be real I don't believe it hey Kate max why did you stop me from jumping what kind of friend are you you never understood me or what happened to me now

have to learn the hard way like Rachel just shut up you're not scaring me anymore I'd be more worried about Chloe killing us than Jefferson max do you really think she has any feelings for us you're

which shirt goes with which skirts this bizarre it up we're leaving and if I say no do you even realize what your life means huh running off like that putting yourself at risk it's pretty goddamn stupid well I guess we're both disappointed with each other then what do you want from me admit that you wanted to get rid of me the whole time Tommy knows this area well I'm sorry I trust him better than I trust myself stop with the bullshit what are you so afraid of that I'm gonna end up like Sam I can't get infected I can take care of myself a little close calls have we had well we seem to be doing all right so far and now you'll be doing even better with Tommy not her you know what Maria told me about Sarah Ellie your tread Nasim mighty thin ice here I'm sorry about your daughter Joel but I have lost people too you have no idea what loss is everyone I have cared for has either died or left me everyone fucking except for you so don't tell me that I would be safer with someone else

have another goddamn meeting about the safety of this lab all of our equipment is here all of our data is here all the personnel have gotten used to living here another test otherwise this incompetence these pink clickers wellmaybe and all that research they turn into fucking monies keep certainly find something that's four pallets of lab equipment all packed up and ready to go big

say we make a pretty good team well yeah lucky lucky no no no such thing as luck now you see I believe and everything happens for a reason sure I do I'm not gonna prove it to you now this winner that's been especially cruel a few weeks back I sent a group of men out nearby town to look for food only a few came back he said that the others had been slaughtered by a crazy man and get the heads he's crazy man traveling a little girl you see everything happens for a reason I'll get upset it's not your fault I'm just a kid James lower the gun no way David I'm not gonna let her know her a gun

friend killed how many men they didn't give us a choice and you think we have a choice is that it you kill to survive and so do we we have to take care of our own by any means necessary so now what you didn't chop me up into tiny pieces I'd rather not please tell me our name you're selfish shit on the contrary I've been that they're quite honest with you now I think it's your turn it's the only

you didn't even need me let's get the hell off this thing yeah hands in the air just my braces hands in the fucking air come welcome to the fireflies sorry about the they don't know who you were Emily she's alright they brought her back you came all this way how'd you do it it was her she fought like hell to get here I he was meant to be I lost most of my crew cross in the country I pretty much lost everything and then you show up and somehow we find you just in time to save her maybe it was meant to be take me to her you don't have to worry about her anymore we'll take care I worry just let me see her please you can't she's being prepped for surgery oh you mean  the doctors tell me the cordyceps the growth inside her that somehow mutated it's why she's immune once they remove it they'll be able to reverse-engineer a vaccine a vaccine but it grows all over the brain it does find someone else there is no one else listen you were gonna show me where's enough stop I get it but whatever it is you think you're going through right now there's nothing to what I have been through I knew her since she was born I promised her mother I would look after her why are you letting this happen because this isn't about me or even her there is no other choice here yeah you keep telling yourself that bullshit Marja matter here he tries anything shoot him don't waste this gift Joe you know I said get up come on move I said move give me an excuse which way the fuck you doing keep walking April Marlene was right the girls infection is like nothing I've never seen the COS affirm unity is uncertain as we've seen in all past cases the antigenic titers of the patient's cordyceps remain high in both the serum and the cerebrospinal fluid blood cultures taken from the patient rapidly grow cordyceps and fungal media in the lab however white blood cell lines including percentages and absolute counts are completely normal there is no elevation of pro-inflammatory cytokines and an MRI of the brain shows no evidence of fungal growth in the regions which would normally accompany the prodrome of aggression and infected patients we must find a way to replicate the state under laboratory conditions we're about to hit a milestone in human history equal to the discovery of penicillin after years of wandering in circles we're about to come home make a difference I bring the human race back into control of its own destiny all of our sacrifices and the hundreds of men and women who've bled for this cause or worse it will not be in vain it's 5:30 p.m. April 28th I just finished speaking more like yelling at our head surgeon apparently there's no way to extricate the parasite without eliminating the host fancy way of saying we gotta kill the fucking kid and now they're asking for my go-ahead the test is getting harder and harder I'm exhausted I just want this so bad hey Anna it's been a while since we spoke I am I just gave me okay to proceed with the surgery I really doubt I had much of a choice asking me was more of a formality I need you to know that I've kept my promise all these years despite everything that I was in charge of I looked after her I would have done anything for her and at times here's a chance to save us all of us this is what we were after what you were after they asked me to kill the smuggler I'm not about to kill the one man in this facility that might understand the weight of this choice maybe forgive me I miss you your daughter will be with you soon sweet Jesus doctor what are you doing in here I won't let you take her this is our future think of all the lives we'll save hey you fucking animal shut the hell up shit I'm getting you out of here girl my gosh come on tell me why crook okay I said get back stop you can't save her even if you get her out of here then what how long before she's torn to pieces by a pack of clickers that is if she hasn't been raped and murdered first Eddie for you to decide it's what she'd want you know it look you can still do the right thing here she won't feel anything ah what the hell am I wearing let's take it easy drugs are still wearing off what happened you found the fireflies turns out there's a whole lot more like you really people that are immune as dozens actually ain't I'm a damn bit of good here if exes they've stopped looking for a cure I'm taking this home I'm sorry wait let me go please you just come after her well looks like we're walking should be a straight shot through here all right actually kind of pretty ain't it yeah alright now watch your head going through feeling my age now I don't think I ever told you but uh Sarah and I used to take hikes like this I think yeah they could - you would have been would have been good friends I think you really would have liked I miss you too like you I bet I would have down there it's a little bit further now yeah I got you give me your hand come on hey wait back in Boston back when I was bitten I wasn't alone my best friend was there and she got bit too we didn't know what to do so she says let's just wait it out you know we can be all poetic and just lose our minds together I'm still waiting for my turn Ellie her name was Riley and she was the first to die and then it was tests and then Sam none of that is on you you don't understand I struggled for a long time with surviving and no matter what you keep finding something to fight for now I know that's not what you want to hear right swear to me swear to me that everything that you've said about the fireflies is true I swear okay you \n",
